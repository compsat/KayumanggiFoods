					Kayumanggi Tropical Foods Inc., a proud Filipino company, is a processor of fruit preserves in the town of Alaminos, in the province of Laguna, Philippines. The company was born out of a desire to provide its customers tropical fruits and native produce without the worry on the fruit’s seasonality or their remote location.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sensing early on the opportunity to preserve foods in sealed bottles using the latest technology, the company set up shop in the 1970s and today continues to strive to be the leading processor, exporter, and distributor of Philippine ethnic foods, specializing in bottled tropical fruits.
				</p>
				<p>
					A constant pursuit of quality food from farm to table is the bedrock of Kayumanggi, and this can only be gauged by the full satisfaction of its esteemed clientiele.
				</p>
				<p>
					With majority of Kayumanggi’s locally manufactured quality products being exported and sold in the international scene since the early seventies, the company takes pride in promoting the Filipino brand while also providing Filipino communities around the globe sweets that bring back memories of home.
